# RaspberryPints
Once Raspberry Pints is successfully installed, how do I setup a tap to appear in the tap list?

Here are my notes for setting up a new beer for the list.

1. Enter the new beer.

2. Create a keg (or use an existing unused keg). Do not select "Serving"! Serving causes the keg to NOT appear in the tap list. Set status to "Secondary".

3. Create a Tap using the beer and keg.

Hope this helps.
